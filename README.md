<h1>Snek</h1>
<ul><h2>NOTES</h2>
<li>probably very inefficient idk</li>
<li>fix flickering screen is to set cpu cycles to max on dosbox options</li>
<li>works on both TASM and MASM</li>
<li>press esc key to exit game</li>
<li>w, a, s, d to move</li>
</ul>

<ul><h2>TODOs/bugs</h2>
<li>flickering graphics on lower cpu cycles which becomes more noticeable as snake gets longer </li>
<li>check for collision with self</li>
<li>score resets to 00 if greater than 15</li>
<li>food collision is not detected in seemingly random instances</li>
<li>food "rng" is not really random; sometimes food spawns on on snake's body </li>
</ul>
